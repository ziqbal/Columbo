# Columbo

About:

Real-time low latency visualization of log files with multiple filters.

Front-end using an open-source admin template built with bootstrap which includes graphing capabilities.

Ajax requests to server for JSON data.

Server scripts that collect log lines and feed to modular filters which create final output.

Access log must be in the following format:

LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b %T/%D \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{Cookie}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined

Date must be in the (default) specific format (example): 15/Mar/2017:10:55:46 +0000

Tested on Mac OS X (Safari/Firefox) using static access log file and on a live linux production server.

Setup:

# All php scripts must be run independently in their own terminal windows
# Start fresh
rm columbo/data/* columbo/logs/*

# Reads sample.log and sends data to the filters
# Change path inside to log file if you don’t use traffic script
php columbo/tail.php

# (Optional) Reads some other access log and appends it to sample.log php columbo/traffic.php > columbo/sample.log

# Run the “requests per second” filter 
php columbo/filters/a.php

# Run the “404’s per second” filter 
php columbo/filters/b.php

# Restart filters ro reset stats

# Load index.html in a modern browser
